# --- Configuration ---
# This script automates the verification of multiple Foundry contracts on Lisk Sepolia testnet using Blockscout.
#
# Instructions:
# 1. Fill in your contract addresses in the `ADDRESSES` array.
# 2. Fill in the corresponding contract paths and names in the `CONTRACTS` array.
# 3. Save the file (e.g., as verify_contracts.sh).
# 4. Make it executable by running: chmod +x verify_contracts.sh
# 5. Run the script from your project's root directory: ./verify_contracts.sh

# Exit immediately if any command fails
set -e
